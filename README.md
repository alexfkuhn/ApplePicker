# ApplePicker

## Project Overview
ApplePicker is a simple physics game developed in Unity with the C# language. Designed and codedas a homework for my CSC476 Game Design class,
the objective of the game is to catch apples which are falling from a moving tree with your baskets. You get three baskets to start, miss an apple and you lose a basket.
As the game goes on, increasingly fast and more difficult to catch apples drop.

## Important Features and Code

Some of the more important features/tasks to complete in the coding of this game was the increasing difficulty of the apple over the course of the game, along with highscore tracking.
Enhanced replayability was the intention of both of these features, along with learning to manipulate settings in Unity. Below are code snippets of how these features were achieved.
